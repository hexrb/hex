# Hex CL
Main repository for the Hex Command Line Console for Roblox.

The Hex command line is a plugin for Roblox Studio that allows users to make edits and changes to their game through a command line interface versus a user interface.

## Commands
### `clear`
When you use this command it will wipe the command line history, allowing you to start on a fresh, clean slate.
Example:
```bash
clear
```

### `cd`
This can be used to change the current directory that you are in.
Example:
```bash
cd ReplicatedStorage.MainModule
```
